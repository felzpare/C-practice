A new author is in the process of negotiating a contract for a new romance novel.
The publisher is offering three options. In the first option, the author is paid $5,000
upon delivery of the final manuscript and $20,000 when the novel is published. In the
second option, the author is paid 12.5% of the net price of the novel for each copy 
of the novel sold. In the third option, the author is paid 10% of the net price 
for the first 4000 copies sold, and 14% of the net price for the copies sold over 4000.
The author has some idea about the number of copies that will be sold and would like to 
to have an estimate of the royalties generated under each option. Write a program
that promps the author to enter the net price of each copy of the novel and the estimated
number of copies that will be sold. The program then outputs the royalties under each
option and the best option the author could choose.
