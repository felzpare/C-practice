The cost of renting a room at a hotel is, say $100 per night.
For special occassions, such as a wedding or conference, the hotel offers a special
discount as follows: If the number of rooms booked is at least 10, the discount is 10%;
at least 20, the discount is 20%; and at least 30, the discount is 30%. Also if the rooms are booked for at least 3 days then
there is an additional 5% discount. Write a program tht prompts the user to enter the cost of renting one room,
the number of rooms booked, the number of days the rooms are booked, and the sales tax(as a percent). The program
outputs the cost of renting one room, the discount on each room as a percent, the number of rooms booked, the
number of days the rooms are booked, the total cost of the rooms, the sales tax, and the total biling amount.
Your program must use appropriate named constants to store special values such as verious discounts.
